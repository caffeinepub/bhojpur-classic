# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish the existing Bhojpur Classic single-page marketing site as a live production deployment on the Internet Computer, accessible via a public HTTPS URL.

**Planned changes:**
- Perform a production deployment of the current site to the Internet Computer.
- Verify the live deployment has no preview/placeholder-only references.
- Validate core live-site interactions (navigation scroll links and the +91 878-9514659 tel: click-to-call link).

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open a public HTTPS URL that loads the Bhojpur Classic marketing page successfully and use its navigation and click-to-call link on the live site.
